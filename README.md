# Beebo

Real-time SSH fleet monitoring TUI — CPU, Memory, and Network sparklines across all your hosts, right in your terminal.

## Features

- **Dashboard Grid** — All SSH hosts from `~/.ssh/config` displayed as tiles, auto-connecting on launch
- **Live Sparklines** — CPU / Memory / Network usage charts updated every 2 seconds
- **Focus Mode** — Enter any tile to get a full interactive SSH terminal (Esc to return)
- **Smart Auth** — Key-based auth by default, falls back to password input in the TUI
- **Auto Reconnect** — Focus a disconnected host to trigger reconnection

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
